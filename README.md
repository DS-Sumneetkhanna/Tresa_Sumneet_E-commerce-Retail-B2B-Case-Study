# Predicting Late Payments in B2B Retail: A Case Study of Schuster

## Overview
Schuster, a multinational retail company specializing in sports goods and accessories, faces challenges with late payments from vendors. This case study explores how data science can be leveraged to understand customer payment behavior, predict the likelihood of delayed payments, and provide insights for better credit management.

## Problem Statement
Schuster aims to:
- Understand customer payment behavior based on past payment patterns (customer segmentation).
- Predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from its customers.
- Prioritize collections efforts to improve payment on time.

## Data Description
The dataset includes historical transactional data containing details of invoices, vendor information, payment dates, and more. Key features include:
- Invoice value
- Creation date
- Payment due date
- Vendor details

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Model Development:** Selection of important predictor attributes, comparison of classification algorithms, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Results and Insights:** Presentation of model performance metrics, interpretation of the model, and business insights derived from it.
